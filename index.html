    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> &#128591 Sabaidee. My name is Felix and I created this website to learn HTML, showcase select skills, and learn about the world. The first lesson in HTML is printing the phrase "Hello, World!" to the World Wide Web. In the spirit of that lesson I've adapted it as an homage to my Lao background, Sabaidee World!</p>
    <p1>     
<pre><code> 
1. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
2. &lt;html&gt;
3. &lt;head&gt;
4. &lt;title&gt;Sabaidee&lt;/title&gt;
5. &lt;/head&gt;
6. &lt;body&gt;
7. &lt;h1&gt;Hello (Sabaidee) World!&lt;/h1&gt;
8. &lt;/body&gt;
9. &lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
  </p1>

<p><strong> HTML Tags explained</strong></p>
    
<ol>
<li><strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong></li>
Specifies the standard: The DOCTYPE informs the browser about the specific HTML version (like HTML5) the page is written in. 

<li><strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong></li>
This is the HTML tag. It defines the structure of the document such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.

<li>&lt;head&gt;</li>
This is the head tag. It instructs the web browser on how to interpret and render the page, including character sets, styling, and script execution

<li><strong>&lt;title&gt;Sabaidee &lt;/title&gt;</strong></li>
This is the title tag. It appears in the tab at the top of the browser window for each open page and helps with search engines like Google.
 
<li>&lt;/head&gt;</li> This closes the &lt;head&gt; tag


<li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
The body tag in HTML defines the main content of an HTML document using a combination of header and paragraph tags, and in this case, greeting you; the world!

<li><strong>&lt;h1&gt;Hello (Sabaidee) World!&lt;/h1&gt;</strong></li>

<li>&lt;/body&gt; </li> This closes the &lt;body&gt; tag
<li><strong>&lt;/html&gt;</strong></li> This closes the &lt;/html&gt;
  
<br> </br>  

Recap: And in the wink of an eye, we've learned a little bit of HTML and the Lao language.

    <h2>Little Wing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Little Wing - SRV:</strong> One of my favorite guitarists is Stevie Ray Vaughan. He led an amazing life as a musician sharing his love for Texas Blues up until the ripe old age of 33. He was tragically taken from the world far too soon in a helicopter crash. One of my favorite songs is called Little Wing. It's become a jazz standard amongst musicians, leaning off Jimi Hendrix's ability to incorporate all 8 notes of Western Music into a single ballad. Learning the intro has been the most challenging yet most rewarding aspect of playing guitar and it's a ritual I share with my son now. </li>

    <p>I use photography to explore light, solitude, and resilience. Here are a few of my favorite shots:</p>

    <h2>Important Tax Documents</h2>
    <p>I trained jiu-jitsu for years before injury and transition shifted my path. Now, I reflect on fitness as a lifelong relationship — one that includes discipline, setbacks, and self-discovery.</p>
