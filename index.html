    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> &#128591 Sabaidee (ສະບາຍດີ) is a commonly used expression in Lao cultures and is a warm greeting to strangers, friends, and family alike. Also, the very first lesson in HTML is printing the phrase "Hello, World!" to the World Wide Web. And in <i>polymerizing</i> these two ideas, Sabaidee World was born, welcome! Follow along with me as I share codeblocks I'm learning and updates from my life as a Lao American. </p>

    <br><p5>Using break tags, &lt;br&gt and &lt;/br&gt, I was finally able to get this proposal post down just so. I actually proposed in Japan with a covert plan that involved a bag of kimchi, a 30-year old film camera, and a little bit of help from a friend. The break tag itself provides line spacing useful for poems and paragraph separation for readability and when I finally found the right combination of images and words, I really wanted to capture that same old feeling we created from Japan. <br>
      The moment felt just right when we were in DC this past weekend. There were several events on Saturday including attempting and breaking the Guiness World Record for the most number of couples kissing under a mistletoe (1,435) and John Cena's final wrestling match at Capital1 Arena.<br>
      After warming up with a bowl of lobster bisque and navigating a temporary power outage at DC's annual Christmas Market, we stumbled across a vendor selling a pair of rings repurposed from war scraps that were Dropped + Made in Laos. And like the break tag, we found our space from something that was originally broken. </br></p5>
